### 1st Challenge: Item Identification
When shown a single item, identify "tops," "bottoms," "balls," and "nothing." Repeat until a conversation comes up, attention span is met, or you do it 12 or so times.
Completed if: Correctly identifies all items.
Otherwise, follow up with: Discuss the missed item. For tops/bottoms, discuss how, when snapped together, the colored part likes to sit on top and the clear part likes to sit on the bottom. Play with that kind of item while calling it "tops," "bottoms," "balls," or "nothing."


1st Challenge Wrap-up: Same, but show the item for only a brief moment.
[Same Completion / Follow-up]


### 2nd Challenge: Number Identification
