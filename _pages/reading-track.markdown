## Storytime

**Goal:** Experience numerals associated with numbers of objects through stories.

_Avoid counting. Embrace 1:1 correspondance or "there's three and three again - that's what six does" kind of reasoning._

**Materials:** Any medium, really. Apps, videos, books. Some ideas:

Book [Peter Rabbit's Counting Book](https://smile.amazon.com/Peter-Rabbits-Counting-Beatrix-Potter/dp/0723244855/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&keywords=beatrix+potter+board+book+number&qid=1624158186&sr=8-12)
Book [Good Night, Numbers](https://smile.amazon.com/Goodnight-Numbers-Danica-McKellar/dp/110193381X/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=board+book+numbers+story&qid=1624158547&sr=8-2)
Book [How Many Beads?](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Many-Beads-My-World/dp/1680106821/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=board+book+how+many+numbers&qid=1624159005&sr=8-5)
_If you find more lnks, let me know!_

### 1st Challenge: Listen to Story
Listen to a story.

### 2nd Challenge: Discuss Numbers
Discuss the numbers as the story goes on .  Look for other examples of the numbers.

### 3rd Challenge: Discuss Numerals
Discuss the numerals as they come up in the story. Laugh at the different twists and turns they do.

### 4th Challenge: Creative Writing with Numerals
Come up with a story using numerals provided. (e.g. “Let’s make a story with this! <points to a 3>” “Sure. Three mice liked cookies …” [when there is a pause] “Can we use one of these, too? <points to 0>” “They saw zero spiders. Because I ate them all.”) Just talk, associating the numerals with the numbers.

When these challenges *and the Handwriting challenges* are done, move to the next Reading Task.
