<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Experience numerals associated with numbers of objects through stories.</p>

<p><em>Avoid counting. Embrace 1:1 correspondance or “there’s three and three again - that’s what six does” kind of reasoning.</em></p>

<p><strong>Materials:</strong> Any medium, really. Apps, videos, books. Some ideas:</p>

<h3 id="4th-challenge-creative-writing-with-numerals">4th Challenge: Creative Writing with Numerals</h3>
<p>Come up with a story using numerals provided. (e.g. “Let’s make a story with this! &lt;points to a 3&gt;” “Sure. Three mice liked cookies …” [when there is a pause] “Can we use one of these, too? &lt;points to 0&gt;” “They saw zero spiders. Because I ate them all.”) Just talk, associating the numerals with the numbers.</p>

<p>When these challenges <em>and the Handwriting challenges</em> are done, move to the next Reading Task.</p>
